# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Dartboard Live Scorekeeping Tool

## Resources  
* [Cricket (darts)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(darts))

Begin the entire project using the "Tabbed Activity" project starter.
Ignore the Tabbed Activity that was created for now.

Create a new empty activity that allows users to choose how many players are in
a game. Press "Begin Game" and start a new ScoreKeeper activity. Use the Tabbed
Activity that was created for the ScoreKeeper activity.

Populate the tabbed activity with Fragments that keep score.

Create a Fragment that controls user interactions with a dartboard.  Use
a canvas to draw a dartboard. Write logic to allow users to drag and tap their
finger around to set scores. A user should be able to set three scores for a
turn and the app should show a list of their hits and score total. Make sure
there's a way for a user to input a "miss" for any of the three shots.

Users should be able to flip through the different tabbed activities to input
scores for each user.

Make one activity that shows the overall scores for each player.
